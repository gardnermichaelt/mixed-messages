# Brainstorm
## Basic idea
NPC interaction in games hasn't really been pushed beyond basic numbered dialog options and canned response. Is it possible to make a character with a basic personality and memories that can be interacted with in more nuanced ways. This is an exploration of this concept. The idea is to connect something like this to natural language processing and outputs.

## Who is the character.
- short stories from the character's life.
    - traumatic experiences from childhood.
    - what is relationship with parents.
    - what was early childhood like, friends, school, etc
- what is character doing now.
    - does the character feel fulfilled?
- what are character's goals.
    - what is holding character back from achieving goals.
- does the character know the player?
- is the context in which the player is interacting with the character making normal sense?
- does the player introduce themselves to the player?
- does the character understand what the player is saying?
